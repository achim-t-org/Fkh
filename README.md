## What is Freddy's Kubernetes Helper (Fkh)

Fkh lets authorised GitHub users work with Business Central containers and perform developer tasks on demand — directly from VS Code, a CLI, or GitHub Actions workflows.

A GitHub-authenticated Azure Function acts as the provisioning gate; Terraform manages all Azure and Kubernetes infrastructure.

### Core Platform
- Plug-and-play Kubernetes setup in your own Azure Subscription
- SQL Server Developer edition with persisted Premium SSD storage
- Autoscaling Windows node pool (scale to zero when idle)
- Optional spot/preemptible nodes for lower cost
- Overprovisioning for near-instant container scheduling
- Fast — containers typically spin up in 1–2 minutes when warm
- Zero human-managed secrets — managed identities, OIDC, and platform credentials only
- Open Source and free to use for your organization

### Container Management
- Create, start, stop, and remove containers with persisted databases
- Configurable CPU, memory, and auto-stop timers per container
- Auto-stop timer with notifications, extend, and admin override
- Full support for multitenancy and AAD/Entra ID authentication
- Custom database restore on create (from backup storage or SAS URL)
- Move all apps to dev scope after database restore
- Pre-pull (warm) images on all Windows nodes for instant starts
- Build and manage container images in Azure Container Registry

### Developer Productivity
- Publish .app files to running containers
- Run PowerShell scripts inside containers
- Copy files to and from containers
- Edit files in containers (download, edit locally, auto-upload on close)
- Open interactive PowerShell terminal in containers (kubectl or backend-based fallback)
- Time-limited external SQL access to container databases
- Execute SQL statements against container databases
- Backup, download, and upload database backups with versioning
- Query installed apps (filter by name, publisher, or appId with wildcards)
- Create and manage Business Central users with permissions, profiles, and license types

### Authentication & Authorization
- GitHub PAT and OIDC token authentication
- GitHub team-based authorization (member and admin teams)
- Brute-force protection (rate-limited failed attempts per IP)
- OIDC authentication from GitHub Actions workflows — no secrets needed

### VS Code Extension
- Catalog-driven command palette — all backend functions available automatically
- AL-Go Projects, Containers, Images, and VMs tree views with inline actions
- One-click container creation from AL-Go project tree
- Auto-update launch.json after container creation (configurable scope and properties)
- Auto-stop approaching notification with one-click extend
- Multi-account and multi-backend support
- Dynamic parameter prompting (file pickers, input boxes, webview forms)
- Admin-only parameters hidden from non-admin users
- Works in GitHub Codespaces and vscode.dev

### CLI
- Generic catalog-driven CLI — auto-discovers all backend functions
- Human-readable output by default, raw JSON with `--asJson`
- PowerShell tab completion
- Deployment repo creation and update (syncs workflow templates from your Fkh fork)
- `--nowait` mode for long-running operations

### Admin Features
- Start and stop the entire AKS cluster with everything persisted
- System status dashboard (nodes, containers, SQL, storage, quotas, security)
- Per-user container quotas and default settings
- Stop all containers at once

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
- AKS cluster with Linux system pool and Windows worker pool
- Azure Container Registry with AKS pull and GitHub Actions push
- Azure Functions on Consumption plan
- Log Analytics, Application Insights, and Container Insights
- Optional Kubecost integration (per-pod cost allocation)

### Coming Soon
- One-click restore online database
- One-click bcapps development support
