# Installing Fkh

This guide walks you through a full Fkh installation using GitHub Actions workflows in a private deployment repository. You do not need local tooling for the installation; the deployment runs in GitHub Actions and Azure.

Use this page to confirm who needs to be involved before you start.

## Installation flow

| Step | File | Main owner | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Create the private deployment repository](Step1-DeploymentRepo.md) | GitHub Organization Admin | A private repo that contains your deployment configuration and caller workflows |
| 2 | [Create the Azure deployment identity](Step2-AzureIdentity.md) | Azure Subscription Owner, and sometimes Entra ID Admin | A deployment identity that GitHub Actions can use to deploy to Azure |
| 3 | [Create the GitHub App](Step3-GitHubApp.md) | GitHub Organization Admin | A GitHub App that can trigger workflows and sync repository secrets |
| 4 | [Set up GitHub teams](Step4-GitHubTeams.md) | GitHub Organization Admin | Teams that control who can use and administer Fkh |
| 5 | [Configure your environment](Step5-ConfigureEnvironment.md) | GitHub Organization Admin | Completed `deployment.tfvars` and required GitHub Secrets |
| 6 | [Deploy](Step6-Deploy.md) | GitHub Organization Admin or repo maintainer | Fkh infrastructure deployed to Azure |

## Roles you need

An Fkh installation touches three systems:

- Azure subscription
- GitHub organization
- Microsoft Entra ID, formerly Azure AD

In a small organization, one person may hold all required permissions. In a larger organization, you may need three people. Confirm the roles below before starting.

### Azure Subscription Owner

This person has the **Owner** role on the Azure subscription where Fkh will be deployed.

They are responsible for:

- Creating or providing the target Azure subscription.
- Assigning **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator** to the deployment identity used by GitHub Actions.
- Approving Azure policy exemptions, if your organization requires them.

> **Why Owner is required:** assigning privileged roles such as **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator** at subscription scope requires the **Owner** role.

### GitHub Organization Administrator

This person can create repositories, GitHub Apps, teams, secrets, and variables in the GitHub organization.

They are responsible for:

- Creating the private deployment repository.
- Creating and installing the GitHub App.
- Creating GitHub teams for Fkh access control.
- Configuring GitHub Actions secrets and variables in the deployment repository.

> **Why a private deployment repository is used:** the deployment repository contains organization-specific configuration such as Azure subscription IDs, GitHub organization names, team names, and GitHub Secrets. It calls reusable workflows from the public `Freddy-DK/Fkh` repository; you do not need to fork Fkh just to deploy it.

> **Optional fork:** fork Fkh only if you want to modify or contribute to the Fkh source code. You can then point the deployment workflows at your fork while testing changes.

### Entra ID Privileged Role Administrator

This person can grant Microsoft Graph application permissions to a Managed Identity or App Registration.

They are responsible for:

- Granting the deployment identity the **Privileged Role Administrator** directory role, but only if you enable AAD container authentication.

> **Why this may be needed:** when AAD container authentication is enabled, the Fkh backend creates a dedicated Entra ID App Registration for each container. The Function App managed identity needs the `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` Microsoft Graph permission to create and manage only the app registrations it owns. Terraform can grant that permission during deployment, but only if the deployment identity has the required Entra ID directory role.

> **Who can usually do this:** someone with **Privileged Role Administrator**, **Global Administrator**, or a role with equivalent permission in your Entra ID tenant. The exact role depends on your tenant configuration.

## Role summary

| Role | System | Minimum permission required |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Subscription Owner | Azure | **Owner** on the target subscription |
| GitHub Organization Admin | GitHub | Ability to create repos, GitHub Apps, teams, secrets, and variables |
| Entra ID Privileged Role Admin | Microsoft Entra ID | **Privileged Role Administrator** directory role, required only for AAD container authentication |

> **Planning tip:** if these roles are held by different people, schedule a short coordination session before beginning. Step 2 is the main point where Azure and Entra ID responsibilities may overlap.
