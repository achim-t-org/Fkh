# Step 1 — Create the Private Deployment Repository

> **Performed by:** GitHub Organization Administrator

In this step you create the private repository that will hold your Fkh deployment configuration, secrets, and caller workflows.

## What you will create

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Fkh repository or fork | Provides reusable workflows, Terraform modules, backend code, CLI, and VS Code extension |
| Private deployment repository | Stores your organization-specific `deployment.tfvars`, GitHub Secrets, and caller workflows |

The deployment repository is private because it contains environment-specific configuration and stores secrets. The Fkh source repository can remain public because it should not contain your organization's secrets or deployment values.

## Repository model

Fkh uses a two-repository model:

| Repository | Visibility | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `Fkh` | Public | Reusable workflows, Terraform modules, backend code, CLI, VS Code extension |
| `fkh-deploy-<deploymentname>` | Private | `deployment.tfvars`, caller workflows, GitHub Secrets |

Each Fkh deployment needs its own deployment repository. You only need one Fkh fork per GitHub organization, even if you create several deployments.

Example:

```text
my-company/Fkh                             ← forked once, public
my-company/fkh-deploy-contoso              ← deployment repo for Contoso
my-company/fkh-deploy-migrateFabrikam      ← deployment repo for Fabrikam migration
my-company/fkh-deploy-litware              ← deployment repo for Litware
```

Each deployment repository can have its own Azure subscription, configuration, secrets, and deployment identity.

> **Optional shared secrets:** if multiple deployments use the same Azure subscription and deployment identity, you can store shared values as GitHub organization-level secrets. Scope those secrets only to the deployment repositories that need them. You still need a separate federated credential for each deployment repository that uses the shared identity.

## 1.1 — Fork the Fkh repository

Skip this section if your organization already has an Fkh fork.

1. Open the [Fkh repository](https://github.com/Freddy-DK/Fkh) on GitHub.
2. Select **Fork**.
3. Under **Owner**, choose your GitHub organization.
4. Keep the repository name as `Fkh`.
5. Select **Create fork**.

> The fork is public by default. That is expected. It should not contain secrets or organization-specific configuration.

## 1.2 — Create the private deployment repository

1. In your GitHub organization, go to **Repositories**.
2. Select **New repository**.
3. Name the repository using this pattern:

   ```text
   fkh-deploy-<deploymentname>
   ```

   Examples:

   ```text
   fkh-deploy-contoso
   fkh-deploy-migrateFabrikam
   fkh-deploy-litware
   ```

4. Set **Visibility** to **Private**.
5. Optionally select **Add a README file**.
6. Select **Create repository**.

> **Naming tip:** use a deployment name that makes the environment easy to recognize, such as a customer, region, team, or project name.

## 1.3 — Copy the deployment template

The Fkh repository includes a `deployment-repo/` folder with the starter configuration and workflow templates.

1. In your Fkh repository or fork, open the `deployment-repo/` folder.
2. Copy everything in that folder into the root of your new private deployment repository.
3. Confirm that the deployment repository looks like this:

```text
your-deployment-repo/
├── config/
│   └── deployment.tfvars
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
└── README.md
```

You can copy the files using the GitHub web UI or by cloning both repositories locally and copying the files.

## 1.4 — Save the repository details

Record these values. You will need them in Step 2 when creating the federated credential for the deployment identity.

| Value | Example |
|---|---|
| GitHub organization name | `my-company` |
| Deployment repository name | `fkh-deploy-contoso` |
| Fkh repository name | `Fkh` |

> **Important:** the federated credential in Step 2 must reference the private deployment repository, not the Fkh source repository. GitHub Actions runs from the deployment repository, so the OIDC token uses the deployment repository name.

## Step complete

You now have a private deployment repository with the starter files in place.
